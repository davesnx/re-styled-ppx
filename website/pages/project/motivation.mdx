# Motivation
I love CSS and I'm coming from the JavaScript world: writing React with styled-components mostly. I found to be one of the best combos for writting scalable frontend applications. When I arrived to Reason wasn't a thing. Even people were asking for it ([a](https://reasonml.chat/t/idiomatic-way-to-bind-to-styled-components/886) [f](https://reasonml.chat/t/styled-components-possible/554)[e](https://reasonml.chat/t/styling-solutions-reasonreact-as-of-aug-18/958)[w](https://reasonml.chat/t/options-and-best-practices-for-styling-in-reasonreact/261) [t](https://twitter.com/lyovson/status/1233397294311100417)[i](https://discord.gg/byjdYFH)[m](https://discord.gg/byjdYFH)[e](https://discord.gg/byjdYFH)[s](https://discord.gg/byjdYFH)).

If you want to know more about how it works or what are the benefits I recommend to watch [my talk at ReasonSTHLM Meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekHCBZiCviM)
